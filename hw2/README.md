This folder contains scripts to solve homework for week 2 of the [MLOps Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp) for the 2024 cohort.
For the actual questions, look [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp/blob/main/cohorts/2024/02-experiment-tracking/homework.md)

To run this you will need to have (in addition to the `python` dependencies), `curl` and `jq` installed on your system.

```bash
bash run_homework.sh
```
Note that after question 3, you will need to interrupt (i.e `Ctrl+C`) to continue after you have taken a look at the results in the `MLflow` UI.
